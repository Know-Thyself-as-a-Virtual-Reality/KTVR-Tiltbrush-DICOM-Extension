# KTVR-Tiltbrush-DICOM-Extension

KTVR-Tiltbrush-DICOM-Extension is a fork of [Google's Tiltbrush](https://github.com/googlevr/tilt-brush). It allows you to load DICOM data into a scene and paint or sculpt in 3D around it. KTVR-Tiltbrush-DICOM-Extension has been created an part of a research project at the University of Alberta called Know Thyself as a Virtual Reality (KTVR). KTVR is an interdisciplinary project that focuses on the ethics and aesthetics of the use of medical data and virtual reality. In order to explore this field, we have assembled a skilled and diverse team from across the University of Alberta as well as from other Canadian and international universities, bringing together expertise in medical imaging, health law, software development, biomedical engineering, virtual narratives, sound, the history of medicine, and artistic creation. The DICOM loader scripts in KTVR-Tiltbrush-DICOM-Extension were written by Walter Ostrander and Kumar Punithakumar.

DICOM data is sensitive personal data and must be treated thoughtfully and respectfully. To help other artists and researchers reflect upon the ethical challenges of working with sensitive personal data, we held an ethics symposium in 2021 and have written Best Practice Guidelines for Working with Personal Data. We use many examples of artworks to discuss issues such as anonymization and consent. We also provide an overview of current data regulations and visual research ethics recommendations.
